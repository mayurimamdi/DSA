# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

This repository contains my DSA practice code and pattern problems in Python.
It includes basic problems, loop patterns, and algorithm implementations
to strengthen fundamentals and prepare for coding interviews.

## Structure

- `patterns/` – Pattern problems (loops, prints, shapes, etc.)
- `arrays/` – Array problems
- `strings/` – String problems
- `others/` – Other categories

## Usage

Each Python file contains code that runs the corresponding problem solution.
Add more problems as you practice!
